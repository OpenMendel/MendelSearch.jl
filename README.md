# MendelSearch
This [Julia](http://julialang.org/) package performs function optimization. MendelSearch permits bounds and linear constraints to be imposed on parameters and, in statistical applications, computes asymptotic standard errors and correlations of parameter estimates. It is one component of the umbrella [OpenMendel](https://openmendel.github.io) project.

## Installation

*Note: The three OpenMendel packages (1) [SnpArrays](https://openmendel.github.io/SnpArrays.jl/latest/), (2) [MendelSearch](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelSearch.jl), and (3) [MendelBase](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelBase.jl) must be installed before any other OpenMendel package will run. It is easiest if these three packages are installed in the above order and before any other OpenMendel package.*

Within Julia, use the package manager to install MendelSearch:

    pkg> add https://github.com/OpenMendel/MendelSearch.jl.git

This package supports Julia v1.0+
